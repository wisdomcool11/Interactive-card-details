Interactive card details

lang: Html, Css and Js

interactive card details from frontend mentors project.
i enjoyed this project because apart from the style required by the front-end mentor i was able to add my own style like, the fliping card.
it was a very fun project especially with the js code it was really fun to write them.
at first i thought i did the most till , i went online and saw how other people have add more style like the thank you page and the oninput, then i knew i needed to also do more.
